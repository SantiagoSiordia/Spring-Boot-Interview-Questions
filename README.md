### Beginner

#### What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a framework that allows you to create production-ready applications quickly. It simplifies the process of creating standalone, production-ready Spring-based applications. It extends the Spring framework, making it easier to create web applications and microservices quickly and with minimal configuration.

Spring Boot is particularly useful for developers looking to build microservices or web applications efficiently

#### Key Features of Spring Boot

- **Autoconfiguration:** Automatically configures your Spring application based on the dependencies you have added.
- **Standalone Applications:** Allows you to create applications that can run independently without needing an external server.
- **Opinionated Defaults:** Provides default configurations to help you get started quickly, while still allowing customization.
- **Embedded Servers:** Comes with embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty, so you don‚Äôt need to deploy WAR files.

#### What is Spring Boot Actuator?

Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of Spring Boot that provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application. It provides a set of built-in endpoints, such as `/health`, `/info`, and `/metrics`, that you can use to monitor your application's health, configuration, and performance.

Some of the features provided by Spring Boot Actuator include:

- Application health checks
- Environment information
- Metrics
- Auditing
- Logging

#### What is Spring Boot Starter?

Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application's build configuration to get a set of dependencies quickly. Starters are a way to group dependencies together to provide a specific set of functionality. For example, you can use the `spring-boot-starter-web` starter to include all the dependencies you need to build a web application.

Starters simplify the process of adding dependencies to your project, as you only need to include a single starter instead of adding multiple dependencies manually.

#### What is Spring Boot CLI?

Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool that allows you to run Spring Boot applications directly from the command line. It provides a quick and easy way to prototype and develop Spring Boot applications without needing to set up a full project structure.

With Spring Boot CLI, you can create, run, test, and debug Spring Boot applications using a simple command-line interface. It also includes features like auto-restart, which automatically restarts your application when you make changes to the code.

- [Spring Boot Documentation: CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-cli.html)
- [Baeldung: Spring Boot CLI](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-cli)

#### What is Spring Boot Initializr?

Spring Boot Initializr is a web-based tool that allows you to quickly generate a new Spring Boot project with the dependencies and settings you need. You can use Initializr to customize your project by selecting the project type, language, build tool, and dependencies you want to include.

Initializr generates a project structure for you based on your selections, including the necessary configuration files, build scripts, and dependencies. You can then download the project as a ZIP file and import it into your favorite IDE to start developing your Spring Boot application.

#### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class in various ways. It helps in making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

In Spring, DI can be achieved through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.

#### What is Spring Security?

Spring Security is a powerful and customizable authentication and access-control framework for Java applications. It provides comprehensive security services for Java EE-based enterprise software applications.

Spring Security is highly configurable and can be used to secure web applications, REST APIs, and method-level security.

#### What is Spring Data JPA?

Spring Data JPA is a part of the larger Spring Data family, which makes it easier to implement JPA-based repositories. It provides a framework that works with JPA to help you create repositories that are easy to test and maintain.

Spring Data JPA reduces the boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various persistence stores.

#### What is Spring Cloud?

Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g., configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state).

Spring Cloud is designed to work well in a cloud environment and provides a set of tools to manage the complexity associated with distributed systems.

#### What is Spring Batch?

Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive batch framework designed to enable the development of robust batch applications vital for the daily operations of enterprise systems. It provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management.

Spring Batch is designed for processing large volumes of data in a consistent and reliable manner.
